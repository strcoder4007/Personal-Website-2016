The greatest turn off for me is bad design of UI & UX in any website or application. I've been a keen observer of design and still learn from every website I open; the font, background, UI/UX and the context which all those has been used in. I have designed several websites and I want my skills to be used by you on a professional level. I have a knack for perfect completion of job, I keep tweaking unless it's perfect. 

I am suitable for designing internship because I will make sure no detail has been left and you get exactly what you wished for. I won't consider project as something to get over with, I will put in the time and assure its quality.
